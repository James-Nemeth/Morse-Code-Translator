# Morse Code Translator

## Requirements / Purpose

### MVP

-   Create a user interface that allows the user to either input some English text or some Morse Code
-   Create JS functions that would allow the user to:

    -   translate their English text into Morse Code
    -   Morse Code into English text
    -   Make sure to add tests for all your translate logic, you want to have some pure functions that take an input and return that input translated

-   Make sure to handle spaces properly (ie. there is 1 space between English words, but one space between Morse Code characters)

## Purpose of project: 
Nology project, Practise unit testing, working with objects and practise using lots of different iterators.
Using JavaScript, SCSS/Sass, HTML.

## Build Steps

-  Made html page with basic styling
-  Set up the testing using Jest and Babel and did a basic test to see if it worked
-  Wrote out my test cases for translating from english to morse.
-  Did the same for morse code to english
-  Then wrote up my Functions for the logic of the translator
-  Sorted the code into modules
-  Worked on the styling of the site for desktop/mobile
-  Did some bug fixes

## Design Goals / Approach

- The focus was on the translator so l went with a 2 colors scheme
- Went with a font that felt right for a translator

---

## Features

- Either Morse code or English can be written into the input and it will be automatically detected and change to the opposite language.
- Any letter of the alphabet and numbers can be translated.
- Morse code spaces are shown as '/' for the user to know each word being translated
- Letters and numbers can be combined in the input

## Known issues

-   N/A

---

## Future Goals

- Clean up the interface and maybe add some more features
  
---

## Change logs

- N/A

---

## What did you struggle with?

- Took a bit to find the right logic to to translate english to morse code, but once l figured it out, it was easier to apply it to morse code to english
- The testing wasn't to bad, just wanted to make sure all the names made sense and that l used enough test cases to make it valid.
